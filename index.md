# Genetics report delivery is changing!

**IMPORTANT: his only affects Haemochromotosis reports currently**

In order to modernise our services and make them as safe and efficient as possible
we are transitioning to reporting via ICE/OpenNet. We are undergoing a testing
period which will mean you will recieve reports via your usual route and ICE but
eventually reports will be sent only via ICE. You can opt-out if you do not want to
recieve reports this way. You will be notified of report into ICE delivery by email.

Take home messages:

* During testing reports will be sent via post and ICE/OpenNet
* You will be notified of ICE report delivery by email
* Provide your email address here
* If you want to continue recieving paper reports please opt-out here
